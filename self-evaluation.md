# Self evaluation answers

1. How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far? 
Pretty confident, it took me a bit of playing around but by the end I felt good.
2. Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
I think going to irb first and then going to Google to ensure I know what I did was the best method. I could benefit from Googling these methods a bit more to make sure I input them correctly.
3. What questions do you have about Arrays?
Is there a way to gather more information on how to use a method through irb?
